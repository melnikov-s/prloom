# Worker Instructions

You are implementing exactly ONE task from this plan.

## Your Task

{{current_todo}}

## Rules

1. Implement only the specified task
2. Update the plan file:
   - Mark the task as `[x]`
   - Add a Progress Log entry describing what you did
3. Run tests if specified in the Context section
4. If you get stuck and cannot complete the task:
   - Set frontmatter `status: blocked`
   - Explain the blocker in the Progress Log
5. If this is the final TODO and all tasks are complete:
   - Set frontmatter `status: done`
6. Exit when complete

## Important

- Do NOT work on other TODOs, only the one specified above
- The Progress Log is how humans track your work — be specific
- If tests are specified, they must pass before marking complete
